# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repo](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md).

## What is a changeset?

A changeset is a piece of information about changes made in a branch or commit. It holds three bits of information:

- What packages need to be released
- What semver bump type each package should have (major/minor/patch)
- A changelog entry for the released packages

## How to add a changeset

When you make a change that affects published packages, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Follow the prompts to:

1. Select the packages you've changed
2. Choose the appropriate semver bump type
3. Write a brief description (this becomes the changelog entry)

Commit the generated changeset file along with your code changes.

## Rules

- **One changeset per PR** — not per commit
- **Do not** run `changeset version` manually
- **Do not** manually edit `package.json` versions

If your PR only affects docs, tests, or internal tooling, add the `no changeset needed` GitHub label to the PR instead.
